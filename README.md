This article, [Why is it so hard to find entry-level software engineering jobs?](https://technical.ly/professional-development/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-entry-level-software-engineering-jobs/), caught my attention because it addresses the challenges that many aspiring software engineers, including myself, face when trying to land a first job in tech. It highlights the paradox where entry-level positions often demand several years of experience, which makes it difficult for new graduates to break into the field. The oversaturation of the market, partly caused by pandemic overhiring and subsequent layoffs, has also intensified competition for junior roles. What I found interesting was the mention of how remote work has widened the candidate pool, making it harder for U.S.-based junior developers to compete with international talent who often come with lower salary expectations. However, the articles does mention that the times are changing, which would be good news for people like me.
